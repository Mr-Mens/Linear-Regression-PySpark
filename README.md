# Linear Regression with PySpark

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Linear Regression model using PySpark, the Python API for Apache Spark. The aim is to provide an example of how to use PySpark for data processing and building a regression model to predict continuous outcomes. 

### Project Repository
[Linear Regression PySpark GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Mr-Mens/Linear-Regression-PySpark.git)

## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploration using PySpark DataFrame API.
- Building a Linear Regression model with PySpark MLlib.
- Evaluation of model performance with common regression metrics.

## Prerequisites
- Apache Spark installed and configured.
- Python 3.x.
- Basic understanding of linear regression and machine learning concepts.

## Usage
To run the project, you'll need to set up a Spark session in your Python environment. The main script can be executed as follows:

Make sure you have a dataset ready for training the linear regression model. The script expects the data to be in a specific format, as outlined in the script comments.

## Data
The project uses a sample dataset (not included in the repository) for training and testing the Linear Regression model. You can replace this with any dataset of your choosing, provided it meets the expected format.
